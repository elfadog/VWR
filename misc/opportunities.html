<body><p>The horticulture industry is in critical need of more automation. The current methods would eventually be inadequate to produce the number of products at the rate at which the demand is growing.  Firstly, according to Jha et al., the increasing growth of the world’s population would eventually antiquate traditional methods of farming (2019). They argue that the increase would result in a higher demand for produce beyond the current technologies’ capacity. Therefore, the introduction and transition to more automation in the horticulture industry is necessary to maintain above the demand for more produce. Secondly, the quality of produce would also increase as machines would be more accurate in judging in comparison to human judgement. According to a study by Leemans et al., image grading of apples in accordance with the European standards were measured by their external defects on machine vision (2002).  Furthermore, the machine’s defect characterisation was based on parameters describing features such “as geometry, colour, texture, and related to calyx and stem ends.” They have found that their proposed method has produced results that allowed healthy fruit to be graded consistently better with an error rate of ten percent. Moreover, compared to individual defect recognition, separating the defects based on constitution of automatic clusters was found to be more efficient. Therefore, machine vision does not only increase the quality of production, but it also expedites the entire process.<p></body>
