<h1>Horticulture and the need for more automation</h1>

<body>Horticulture is one of the oldest forms of art of cultivation. It focuses more on the cultivation of plants to produce for food, medicine, or decorative purposes <em>(Preece and Read, 2005).</em> Being one of the oldest art forms, it is certain that the practices within the art have stood the test of time. However, ever since the urbanization of countries, the demand for produce has increased exponentially. From supermarkets wanting to fill up baskets, juice companies needing fresh fruit to squeeze, and restaurants needing fruit to serve, the horticulture industry has had to make great progress in order to satisfy the marketâ€™s needs. However, the horticulture industry has been facing a different problem in recent years. For instance, labour shortages induced by the covid pandemic have cost the apple industry one hundred million dollars because there were no workers to pick the apples during the harvest season <em>(Hughes, 2021).</em> There is a need for more workers in the industry, but after the pandemic there is still an insufficiency of workers in the field. Our group proposes automation such as robotics, embedded systems, and machine learning systems as a solution to those problems that the industry has been facing now.</body>
