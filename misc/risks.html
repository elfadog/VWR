<h4><p>Risks presented to, Horticulture and the need for more automation.<p></h4>

<body>However, the standardization of automation in the horticulture industry does have a few potential issues that it may bring. One of the biggest risks involved with implementing automation within the industry is the number of jobs that would be lost due to technological unemployment, within the horticulture industry in New Zealand there are over eighty-four thousand people employed, if smart systems are to be implemented it would mean that many people could be made redundant. A side effect of this would be the worry of job security for people working within the industry, which could have a negative effect on the productivity and efficiency of these workers further resulting in more automation to be thought about. Another major risk of implementing a large amount of automation within the industry is the data accuracy and recommendations based on data collected. A few ways automation was introduced within the industry, was firstly done with sensors on farming equipment that would analyze the data collected and would make recommendations back to the farmer, secondly with programs to identify hybrid seed selection, growth calculations, and planting methods. The use of sensors, and certain programs within the industry, has been helpful for some parts of the industry due to the datasets being small, within large farm datasets the data accuracy for this method of automation has been shown to decrease therefore recommendations using this technology could cause problems within the production period. The risks for use of automation within the horticulture industry are major and could cause environmental and ethical problems. The opportunities for automation outweigh the risks heavily and it would benefit the industry to move forward with automation and with returns from saved costs of production there could be advancements made to reduce the risks further therefore providing a low-cost product.</body>
