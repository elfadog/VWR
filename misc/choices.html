<h1>Choices</h1>


</ul><h4><p>Positive choices available to us through automation in Horticulture.<p></h4>

<body>The horticulture industry’s reliance on automation is increasing as there more orchards and produce farms being developed throughout the world, particularly in New Zealand. The demand for more automation in the horticulture industry is vital, as it helps to ensure that grower’s food does not go to waste. By creating an industry that depends on automation we can limit the amount of food that goes to waste.<br>
Through automation we can calibrate robotics to operate in certain parameters. Doing so reduces the risk for error when humans need to exist around machines. In addition to setting machine parameters the risk of damaged produce is greatly reduced, resulting in more produce that can be exported and sent to the local market, thus reducing the waste.
In the horticulture industry there are a variety of harmful jobs. From spraying agrichemicals to operating machines that have the capacity to crush humans if error is encountered. Allowing automation aided with robotic features to handle these tasks can help to minimize human interaction.<br>
As the horticulture industry has struggled to find the required labour throughout the pandemic, automation has stepped up. By allowing simple tasks such as packing fruit, creating boxes, and lining trays to be driven by machine interaction we can move human interaction around the industries to areas that are struggling to cope with a lack of labour. Especially into tasks that have not had as much research and development or require more funding as the tasks have complex steps involved.<br> 
By incorporating more and more automation in the industry, we can offset the overall cost required to run the horticulture business. As more and more industries get behind automation, the lower the cost of research and trials is required as eventually we see the industry will move to live testing in orchards and packhouses. Doing so there is more data available to automation engineers and what systems can be developed.
